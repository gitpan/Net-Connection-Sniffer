NAME
    Net::Connection::Sniffer -- gather stats on network connections

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Connection::Sniffer;

      gather($config)

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Connection::Sniffer is a perl module to gather connection
    statistics by listening to ethernet traffic. Traffic is filtered using
    standard BPF notation as described in the "tcpdump" documentation and
    implemented using the standard "pcap" library to sniff packets on host
    network interfaces.

CONFIGURATION
    Create a directory with appropriate permissions for the pid file and the
    profile statistics dump file. Typical installation:

      mkdir -p /var/run/nc.sniffer

    Edit the nc.sniffer.pl.sample file to change or set the following:

      my $config = {

      # specify the directory for the pid file for this daemon.
      # The directory must exist and have writable permissions.
      # [required]
      #
            piddir  =>  '/var/run/nc.sniffer',

      # specify the directory for the statistics file for this 
      # daemon. The directory must exist and have writable
      # permissions
      # [required]
      #
            sniffer =>  '/var/run/nc.sniffer',

      # BPF filter statement. See examples below.
      # [required]
      #
            bpf     => 'src host myhost.com and tcp port 80',

      # UDP listen port to trigger a dump file
      # [optional]
      #
            port    => 10004,

      # HOST address on which to listen
      # may be one of a HOSTNAME, IP address, or
      # strings 'INADDR_ANY', 'INADDR_LOOPBACK'
      # [optional] default 127.0.0.1 == INADDR_LOOPBACK
      #
            host    => 'INADDR_LOOPBACK',

      # ALLOWED connecting host(s)
      # may be HOSTNAME or IP address
      # [optional] default 127.0.0.1
      #
            allowed => ['127.0.0.1',],

      };

    To generate a web report to STDOUT with or without a cache file, edit
    the nc.sniffer.cgi.sample file to change or set the configuration
    parameters. See the Net::Connection::Sniffer::Report manpage::web_report
    or the sample file for details.

      Usage: <!--#exec cmd="./nc.sniffer.cgi 0" -->
        or   <!--#exec cmd="./nc.sniffer.cgi 1" -->

    where an argument of "0" produces a report ordered by /24 by usage and
    an argument of "1" produces a report ordered by subdomain by usage.

OPERATION
    Launch the daemon with the command:

            nc.sniffer.pl start

      Syntax: nc.sniffer.pl start
              nc.sniffer.pl stop
              nc.sniffer.pl restart
              nc.sniffer.pl status
              nc.sniffer.pl dump
              nc.sniffer.pl config

              -d switch may be added to
               redirect output to STDERR

    On most systems it will be necessary to wrap a shell script around
    nc.sniffer.pl if the path for perl is not in scope during boot.

      #!/bin/sh
      #
      # shell script 'rc.nc.sniffer'
      #
      /path/to/nc.sniffer.pl $*

    A sample shell script is included in the distribution as rc.nc.sniffer

    To run multiple copies of nc.sniffer for data collection on various
    ports or IP's at the same time, name them:

            nc.sniffer1.pl
            nc.sniffer2.pl
            etc...

      start         start daemon if not running, write pid file
      stop          stop a running daemon
      restart       do stop, then start
      status        report if daemon running or not
      dump          refresh/write statistics file
      config        print configuration to STDOUT

SIGNALS
    The statistics information will be written to the file specified in the
    configuration upon receipt of a SIG USR1

            SIG     TERM            write stats file, terminate
            SIG     HUP             write stats file, start over
            SIG     USR1            write statistics file

UDP listener -- statistics file dump
    If the nc.sniffer daemon is configured for a UDP listen port, sending a
    message dump will produce the same result as SIG USR1. The daemon will
    respond OK timestamp, but this is NOT syncronized with the file dump and
    only indicates that the statistics file should not have a timestamp
    earlier that the epoch value returned. When either a dump or SIG USR1 is
    issued, you must check the ctime of the file to determine if it has been
    updated.

BUGS / RESTRICTIONS
    Net::Connection::Sniffer uses libpcap. The data collection is
    accomplished using a selectable capture device which is NOT SUPPORTED on
    Windows and some older BSD platforms. The next two paragraphs are from
    the pcap library and describe the platform limitations.

    Some "BPF" ...devices do not support select() or poll() (for example,
    regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4, and Endace DAG
    devices)...

    ...On most versions of most BSDs (including Mac OS X), select() and
    poll() do not work correctly on BPF devices. "While a BPF file
    descriptor will be returned" ...on most of those versions (the
    exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), a simple select() or poll() will
    not return even after a... "specified timeout" expires... ...In FreeBSD
    4.6 and later, select() and poll() work correctly on BPF devices...

BPF EXAMPLES
    The bpf entry in the configuration hash uses the standard language
    documented in detail in the tcpdump man(1) page. The bpf statement must
    contain at a minimum, 'host somename [or IP address]'. The host
    specification must be for a single unique IP address and be the first
    such specification if there are multiple src/dest host specifications in
    the statment.

    Capture all traffic to/from a particular host:

      bpf   => 'host particular.host.com',

    Capture traffic to/from your mail server:

      bpf   => 'host my.mx.com and tcp port 25',

    Capture request traffic arriving at your DNS server:

      bpf   => 'dst host my.dns.com and udp port 53',

    Capture response traffic leaving your DNS server:

      bpf   => 'src host my.dns.com and udp port 53',

DUMP FILE FORMAT
    The dump file is written in a format compatible with that produced by
    Data::Dumper. It may be imported for analysis using Perl's 'do' or by
    using File::SafeDO.

EXPORTS
    Only one function is exported by Sniffer.pm. This function is called in
    the nc.sniffer.pl.sample script to launch the nc.sniffer daemon.

    gather($config);
        Launch the nc.sniffer daemon.

          input:        config hash
          returns:      nothing (exits)
